# Hey 👋🏻

Welcome to the assessment test for the Full-Stack Developer position at Giftery!

This test is designed to evaluate your skills and creativity in full-stack development, specifically focusing on SvelteKit.

Your task is to build a web application that allows users to add, manipulate, and download squares on a canvas. The project intentionally uses a library you're probably not familiar with (fabric.js) – you can find a link to the documentation in the comments.

## Features to Implement
You'll find everything written in comments in the files.

## Technical Requirements
- Frontend: Svelte, Fabric.js for canvas manipulation
- Backend: SvelteKit
- Styling: the repo is set up with Tailwind, but you can write vanilla CSS if you'd like

## How to set up and submit
1. Clone this repo
2. Build the app according to the description – please also log how much time you're spending on this
3. Once you're done, publish your code to a GitHub repo and send us the link 🥳
